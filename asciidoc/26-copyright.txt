[[copyright]]
=== debian/copyright

Debian takes the copyright and license matters very seriously. The ``Debian Policy Manual'' enforces to have summary of them in the *debian/copyright* file in the package.

You should format it as the http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/[machine-readable debian/copyright file] (DEP-5).

CAUTION: The *debian/copyright* file should be sorted to keep the generic file patterns at the top of the list.  See <<koption>>.

The *debmake* command creates the initial DEP-5 compatible template file by scanning the entire source tree.  It uses an internal license checker to classify each license text. footnote:[The *licensecheck* command from the *devscripts* package was referenced to make this internal checker.  Now the *licensecheck* command is provided in an independent *licensecheck* package.]

Unless specifically requested to be pedantic with the *-P* option, the *debmake* command skips reporting for auto-generated files with permissive licenses to be practical.

NOTE: If you find issues with this license checker, please file a bug report to the *debmake* package with the problematic part of text containing the copyright and license.

NOTE: The *debmake* command focuses on bunching up same copyright and license claims in details to create template for *debian/copyright*.  In dorder to do this within reasonable time, it only picks the first section which looks like copyright and license claims.  So its license assignment may not be optiomal.  Please also use other tools such as *licensecheck* which deploy simpler string match rules running on the whole source tree.

TIP:  You are highly encourage to check the license status with the *licensecheck*(1) command and, as needed, with your manual code review.

[[dfsg]]
=== DFSG

Debian takes software freedom seriously and follows the https://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines[DFSG].

The non-https://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines[DFSG] components in the upstream source tarball can be easily removed when the *uscan* command is used to update the Debian package.

* List the files to be removed in the *Files-Excluded* stanza of the  *debian/copyright* file.
* List the URL to download the upstream tarball in the *debian/watch* file.
* Run the *uscan* command to download the new upstream tarball.
** Alternatively, use the ``*gbp import-orig --uscan --pristine-tar*'' command.
* The resulting tarball has the version number with an additional suffix *+dfsg*.
